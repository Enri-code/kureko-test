# Kurero Task

Welcome to Kurero's Group Chat test task.

## Description

This Kurero project task was created to demonstrate a simple group chat application using Flutter, focusing on BLoC for state management. It utilizes the BLoC pattern for managing the application's state, as well as Hive storage to persist the chat messages. These are automatically handled with a package called **hydrated_bloc**.

## Project Structure

Every feature is very well separated from each other and inside the feature, the UI code and business logic is separated as per 'Clean Architecture + Domain driven architecture' thereby providing the separation of concern.
